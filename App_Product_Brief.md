# Product Brief: Tendly — Property Management for Small Landlords

## What It Is

Tendly is a mobile-first property management app built specifically for independent landlords managing 2–20 rental units. It replaces the mess of spreadsheets, text threads, Venmo requests, and manila folders that most small landlords use today with a single, AI-assisted workspace for rent collection, maintenance coordination, tenant communication, and financial tracking.

This is not a scaled-down version of enterprise software like AppFolio or Buildium. It is purpose-built for the person who owns a duplex and still has a day job.

## Why This, Why Now

There are over **10 million small landlords in the US**, and the vast majority manage their properties with improvised tools. 72% of them cannot even calculate their return on investment. Enterprise property management platforms start at $1–$3 per unit per month *at scale* but quickly become bloated, complex, and expensive for someone with a handful of units. The result is a massive population of underserved users sitting in a gap between "doing it all manually" and "paying for software designed for 500-unit portfolios."

The market research is clear: vertical B2B SaaS targeting underserved industries ranks as the single highest-opportunity category for new developers, and small landlord tooling is called out specifically as a validated, very-low-competition niche with proven willingness to pay $8–12 per unit per month.

## Who It's For

**Primary user:** An individual who owns 2–20 rental units (single-family homes, duplexes, small apartment buildings). They likely have a primary job outside of property management. They are not property management professionals — they are people who happen to own rental property and need it to not consume their life.

**Secondary user:** Their tenants, who interact with the app to pay rent, submit maintenance requests, and communicate with their landlord.

## Core Feature Set

### 1. Rent Collection & Financial Dashboard
- Automated rent invoicing and payment reminders
- Accept payments via ACH, card, or manual logging (for cash/check tenants)
- Per-property and portfolio-wide P&L view: income, expenses, mortgage, taxes, insurance
- Auto-calculated ROI and cap rate per property — the number 72% of landlords can't produce today
- Export-ready tax summaries (Schedule E alignment)

### 2. Maintenance Request Pipeline
- Tenants submit requests with photos and descriptions through their tenant-facing view
- AI triage: incoming requests are auto-categorized by urgency (emergency, urgent, routine) and trade type (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, general)
- Landlord approves, assigns to a saved vendor, or resolves directly
- Full history per unit — no more digging through text messages to remember when the water heater was last serviced

### 3. Tenant Communication Hub
- In-app messaging replaces scattered texts and emails
- All communication is timestamped and tied to the property/unit for record-keeping
- AI-assisted message drafting for common scenarios: lease violation notices, maintenance updates, renewal offers, move-out instructions

### 4. Lease & Document Management
- Store leases, inspection photos, receipts, and insurance documents per property
- AI extraction of key lease terms (rent amount, lease dates, renewal clauses, pet policies) from uploaded PDFs
- Automated reminders for lease expirations, insurance renewals, and inspection schedules

### 5. AI Assistant ("Tend")
- A conversational assistant trained on landlord-tenant law basics (state-specific where possible), common maintenance troubleshooting, and financial best practices
- Example queries: *"Can I charge a late fee in California after 5 days?"*, *"What's my net cash flow across all properties this year?"*, *"Draft a notice for a noise complaint."*
- This is not legal advice — it is an informed starting point with clear disclaimers

---

## What It Is Not

- **Not a tenant-finding platform.** No listing, screening, or applicant management at launch. The user already has tenants.
- **Not an accounting suite.** Financial tracking is simplified and landlord-specific, not a general ledger.
- **Not enterprise software.** No multi-team permissions, no portfolio-level analytics for institutional investors, no API integrations at launch.

Keeping the scope narrow is the product strategy. Every feature must pass the test: *does a person with 4 rental units and a full-time job actually need this?*

## Monetization

**Subscription model, priced per unit per month.**

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| Starter | Free | Up to 2 units. Core rent tracking and messaging. |
| Standard | $9/unit/month | All features, up to 20 units. AI assistant included. |
| Annual | $7/unit/month (billed annually) | Same as Standard. ~22% discount incentivizes annual commitment. |

Annual plans are the target conversion — the research shows annual subscribers churn 51% less and are 2.4x more profitable. The free tier exists to eliminate friction for the smallest landlords and serve as a growth funnel.

Tenant-side access is always free. Tenants never pay.

## Platform Priority

1. **iOS (launch)** — captures the majority of consumer app revenue and the highest willingness to pay
2. **Web app (fast follow)** — essential for document management, financial review, and the B2B-adjacent nature of the product
3. **Android (v2)** — expands reach after product-market fit is validated

---

## What Success Looks Like at 12 Months

- 5,000+ landlords actively managing properties in the app
- $40K–$80K MRR
- 60%+ of paying users on annual plans
- Tenant adoption rate of 70%+ per landlord (tenants actually using the app for payments/requests)
- Net Promoter Score above 50

## Summary

Tendly sits at the intersection of the three strongest signals in the 2025 app market: vertical SaaS targeting an underserved industry, AI as a workflow enhancer rather than a standalone product, and subscription monetization with a clear freemium funnel. The competitive landscape is nearly empty at this scale, the target user is easy to identify and reach, and the pricing model is validated. Build something genuinely simple for people managing a handful of properties, and the market is there.
